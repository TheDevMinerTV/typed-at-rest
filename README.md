# `typed-at-rest`

`typed-at-rest` is a little helper utility I've developed to make it easier to work with NextJS APIs and `fetch` in the browser and to make them more type-safe.

## TODO

- [ ] NextJS App Directory route handler
- [ ] React Query client
- [ ] Release on NPM and GitHub Packages
- [ ] More examples

## Developing

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 18+
- Corepack (`npm i -g corepack`)

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm i

pnpm dev
```

## Example

For examples, see the `examples/` directory.
